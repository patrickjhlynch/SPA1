		<h1>Seeing Networks in Wellington</h1>
	</section>
	</header>
	<section>
		<p>
			Over two days I searched the streets of Wellington City, trying to find traces of the internet - be it markings on the footpath showing where underground cables were running, or all-too conspicuous cameras in front of shop windows. I took photographs and noted where the most devices were gathered in one location.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main focus of my search was the Wellington City central area, as that was my commute home from the Te Aro campus. I did go out of my way to see the Datacom building, and I tried to take streets that I thought would have more network devices on them.
		</p>
		<p>
			This website is the result of my efforts to document the network devices found in Wellington City.

				Located on Abel Smith St, DATACOM says on its website they are responsible for infrastructure outsourcing and data centre hosting in Wellington. They also have ties with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and RealMe, which are government affiliated.

		<h3>Spark Building</h3>

			<p>
				Located on Willis St, this is the Spark New Zealand headquarters - the second largest mobile network in the country. On their website they state that they "provide voice, managed data, mobile, procurement and IT services to around 80% of all government agencies." Spark used to be known as Telecom, but changed their name in 2014.

				The vast majority of these cameras appear to be variations on dome CCTV cameras, which can be vandal-proof, as well as have infra-red sensors inside them. The camera outside Sal's Pizza is the only non-dome camera, and appears to have a light as well as a lens. Traffic cameras are also seen here, and were situated at two intersections - Cuba and Vivian Street, and Manners and Victoria Street.

				These were all found on the corner of Abel Smith St and Wigan St. F.O stands for Fibre Optic, and CHOR is likely an abbreviation for Chorus. VECTOR can also be made out.

				Chorus was once part of Telecom New Zealand, but split off from the parent company to become its own networking company (with the remainder of the company becoming todayâ€™s Spark, a mobile company).

				These boxes appeared on traffic lights and streetlight poles, and as such I imagine they connect to the traffic lights in order to organise the city's traffic and connect all intersections up. It's also possible that some of these boxes are Distributed Antenna Systems, which extend a cell network's reach.

				These boxes were outside some stores, and appeared to have ethernet cables coming out of them - as such I imagined they connect the buildings to the internet in some way.

				These connect cellphones to the internet that are using their cellular data. These are often located on the tops of buildings rather than street level as it extends their range and reliability, and as such I only managed to find one on my search.
